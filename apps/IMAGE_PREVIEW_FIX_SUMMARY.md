# Image Preview Disappearing - Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem
When uploading images, the preview would appear for a split second and then disappear immediately.

## Root Cause
The image was being removed from state when the upload failed. If there were any errors during the S3 upload (CORS issues, network errors, etc.), the image would be filtered out of the `productImages` state, causing it to disappear.

```typescript
// OLD CODE - Removed image on failure
.catch((error) => {
  setProductImages((prev) => prev.filter((img) => img.id !== imageId));
});
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Keep Images in State (Don't Remove on Error)
Images are now kept in state even if upload fails. They show an error overlay instead of disappearing.

```typescript
// NEW CODE - Keep image, show error
.catch((error) => {
  setProductImages((prev) =>
    prev.map((img) =>
      img.id === imageId
        ? {
            ...img,
            isUploading: false,
            uploadError: errorMsg,
          }
        : img
    )
  );
});
```

### 2. Add Error State to Image Model
```typescript
interface ProductImage {
  id: string;
  preview: string;
  file?: File;
  s3Url?: string;
  isUploading?: boolean;
  uploadError?: string;  // ← NEW
}
```

### 3. Display Error Overlay
When upload fails, a red overlay shows the error message instead of removing the image:

```typescript
{image.uploadError && !image.isUploading && (
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-red-500/90 flex items-center justify-center p-2">
    <div className="text-white text-xs text-center">
      <p className="font-semibold mb-1">Upload Failed</p>
      <p>{image.uploadError}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 4. Better Error Logging
Enhanced error handling in the S3 upload hook to log detailed error information:

```typescript
catch (error) {
  if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) {
    console.error('S3 upload error details:', {
      status: error.response?.status,
      data: error.response?.data,
      message: error.message,
    });
  }
  return null;
}
```

### 5. Smart Form Submission
- Warn users if uploads are still in progress
- Ask for confirmation if there are failed uploads
- Only include successfully uploaded images in product data

```typescript
// Check if there are any failed uploads
const failedImages = productImages.filter((img) => img.uploadError);
if (failedImages.length > 0) {
  const confirmSubmit = window.confirm(
    `${failedImages.length} image(s) failed to upload. Continue without them?`
  );
}
```

## What Users Will See Now

1. **Upload Starting**: Image preview appears with loading spinner
2. **Upload Successful**: Green "Uploaded" badge appears
3. **Upload Failed**: Red overlay shows error message
   - Image stays visible for user to delete or retry
   - User can still submit form (failed images excluded)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Upload an image → should stay visible until upload completes
- [x] Trigger upload error → should show red error overlay
- [x] Check browser console → should see detailed error logs
- [x] Submit form with failed uploads → should ask for confirmation
- [x] Submit form with successful uploads → should save product with images

## Debugging Info

To see detailed S3 upload errors, open browser DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab. You should see messages like:

```
S3 upload error details: {
  status: 403,
  data: {...},
  message: "..."
}
```

This will help identify if it's:
- **CORS Error**: S3 bucket CORS not configured
- **403 Forbidden**: AWS credentials invalid or permissions missing
- **Network Error**: Backend not responding
- **File Size Error**: File too large (max 10MB)
