# Dashboard Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Logout Button Not Working
**Problem**: The logout button was calling a non-existent `logout()` function from the old AuthContext.

**Solution**: Updated to use Clerk's `signOut()` method:
```tsx
const { signOut } = useClerk();

const handleLogout = async () => {
  try {
    await signOut();
    navigate({ to: "/auth/login" });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Logout error:", error);
  }
};
```

### 2. Page Stuck Loading
**Problem**: The page was trying to use the old authentication system and waiting for user data that never came.

**Solution**:
- Updated to use Clerk's authentication state from AuthContext
- Added proper loading states
- Added fallback UI when user isn't synced to database yet
- Added automatic redirect to login if not signed in

### 3. Added Debug Tools
**Added Features**:
- Manual sync button (DebugSyncUser component) - only shows in development
- Better error messaging when user not found in database
- Clerk user info display for debugging (only in dev mode)
- Clear loading states

## Files Modified

### `/routes/dashboard/overview.tsx`
- ✅ Updated to use `useClerk()` for logout
- ✅ Updated to use new AuthContext with Clerk
- ✅ Added `DebugSyncUser` component for manual sync
- ✅ Added proper loading states
- ✅ Added redirect logic for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Added helpful error messages
- ✅ Added debug info for development

### `/middleware/auth.ts`
- ✅ Simplified all middleware functions
- ✅ Removed old localStorage token checks
- ✅ Moved auth checks to component level (where they work better with Clerk)

## How It Works Now

### Dashboard Access Flow:
1. User navigates to `/dashboard/overview`
2. Component checks if user is signed in with Clerk (`isSignedIn`)
3. If not signed in → redirect to login
4. If signed in → show dashboard
5. If signed in but not in database → show sync button

### Logout Flow:
1. User clicks "Logout" button
2. Clerk's `signOut()` is called
3. Clerk clears the session
4. User is redirected to `/auth/login`

## What You'll See

### When User is Synced:
```
Dashboard Overview                                  [Logout]
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Welcome back, John Doe! 👋                              │

│ Email: john@example.com                                 │
│ Role: customer                                          │
│ Database User ID: abc-123                               │
│ Clerk ID: user_xyz                                      │
│                                                          │
│ You are successfully authenticated with Clerk and       │
│ synced to the database.                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When User is NOT Synced (Development Only):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚧 DEBUG MODE - Manual User Sync                        │
│ If you just registered/logged in but your user data     │

│ [Sync User to Database]                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Dashboard Overview                                  [Logout]
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ User not found in database                           │
│                                                          │
│ You're logged in with Clerk, but your user data hasn't  │
│ been synced to the database yet. Use the sync button    │
│ above to manually sync your user.                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Testing

### Test Logout:
1. Go to `/dashboard/overview`
2. Click "Logout"
3. Should redirect to `/auth/login`
4. Try accessing `/dashboard/overview` again
5. Should immediately redirect back to login

### Test Loading:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/overview` while logged in
3. Should see "Loading user information..." briefly
4. Then show user data

### Test Manual Sync (if user not in database):
1. Register/login with Clerk
2. Go to `/dashboard/overview`
3. See "User not found in database" warning
4. Click "Sync User to Database"
5. User data should appear
6. Page should refresh and show user info

## Production Notes

Before deploying to production:
1. Remove the `DebugSyncUser` component (it's already wrapped in `import.meta.env.DEV`)
2. Remove the `DebugController.cs` from backend
3. Make sure webhooks are properly configured with your production URL
4. Users will automatically sync via webhooks - no manual sync needed

## Next Steps

If you're still seeing issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check that `.env` has the correct Clerk publishable key
3. Check that backend is running
4. Try the manual sync button
5. Set up ngrok for proper webhook testing (see WEBHOOK_SETUP_LOCAL.md)
