## Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)

The 53 warnings are primarily code style and best practice suggestions:

### Warning Categories

**1. Nullable Reference Warnings** (~20 warnings)
- Possible null reference returns
- Dereference of possibly null references
- These are safe in the current context but indicate potential null handling opportunities

**2. Code Style Suggestions** (~20 warnings)
- Parentheses can be removed (IDE0047)
- Collection initialization can be simplified (IDE0305)
- Member name simplification (IDE0037)
- Use primary constructors (IDE0290)

**3. Performance Suggestions** (~10 warnings)
- `Count()` should use `Any()` for better performance (CA1827)
- Case-insensitive string comparison improvements (CA1862)

**4. Best Practices** (~3 warnings)
- Static method suggestions (CA1822)

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. Preprocessor Directive Issue
**Problem:** Line 854 had unexpected `#endregion`
**Solution:** Removed duplicate region marker

### 2. Type Casting Issues
**Problem:** `.Average()` method returns `double` but properties expect `decimal`
**Solution:** Added explicit casts: `(decimal)variable.Average(...)`

**Affected methods:**
- GetRepeatCustomerMetrics (line 717)
- GetProductPerformance (line 888-889)
- GetVendorPerformance (line 1086)
- GetReviewSummary (line 1321)
- GetProductRatings (line 1379)
- GetTopRatedProducts (line 1416)
- GetLowRatedProducts (line 1450)
